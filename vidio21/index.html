<!-- The cascade alorithm is a set of rules that browsers use to determine
which CSS styles to apply when multiple styles could apply to the same
element. The rules are based on specificity, importance, and source order. -->

Order of specificity: INLINE STYLE > ID SELECTOR > CLASS OR ATRIBUTE SELECTOR > ELEMENT SELECTOR
